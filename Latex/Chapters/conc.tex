In the original dataset, there were 92 stations and 91 chargers, each with different power speeds \([14.2, 11.5, 19.2, 25, 60, 62, 80, 120, 150, 180, 200, 240, 250, 300, 325, 350, 400]\). After applying the NSGA-II algorithm, the following objectives were addressed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Maximize coverage.
    \item Maximize the speed of the charger to reduce the waiting time.
    \item Minimize the number of stations.
    \item Minimize the number of chargers.
\end{enumerate}

The aim was to develop a solution that finds a balance between these objectives.

As a result, the optimization process led to a reduction in the number of stations to 66 and a decrease in the number of chargers to 81. In general, optimizing station locations ensured the best possible coverage, while reducing the number of stations and chargers per station contributed to a decrease in associated costs.
